He dazzled her eyes; He bewildered her brain;  
He caught her affections so light and so vain,  
And carried her home as his Spouse.  

And now had the Marriage been blest by the Priest;  
The revelry now was begun:  
The Tables, they groaned with the weight of the Feast;  
Nor yet had the laughter and merriment ceased,  
When the Bell of the Castle told,â€”'One!'  

Then first with amazement Fair Imogine found  
That a Stranger was placed by her side: His air was terrific;  
He uttered no sound; He spoke not, He moved not,  
He looked not around,  
But earnestly gazed on the Bride. </pre></div> </div>
