I see thee cast a wishful look,  
Where reputations won and lost are  
In famous row called Paternoster.  
Incensed to find your precious olio  
Buried in unexplored port-folio,  
You scorn the prudent lock and key,  
And pant well bound and gilt to see  
Your Volume in the window set  
Of Stockdale, Hookham, or Debrett.  

     Go then, and pass that dangerous bourn </pre></div> </div>
