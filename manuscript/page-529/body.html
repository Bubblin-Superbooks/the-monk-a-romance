<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
The snares of vice I view with scorn;  
Thanks, that to-night as free from ill  
I sleep, as when I woke at morn.  

     Yet may not my unconscious breast  
Harbour some guilt to me unknown?  
Some wish impure, which unreprest  
You blush to see, and I to own?  

     If such there be, in gentle dream  
Instruct my feet to shun the snare;  
Bid truth upon my errors beam,  
And deign to make me still your care.  

     Chase from my peaceful bed away  
The witching Spell, a foe to rest,  
The nightly Goblin, wanton Fay, </pre></div> </div>
