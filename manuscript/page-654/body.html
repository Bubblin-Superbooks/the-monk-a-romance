His vizor was closed, and gigantic his height;  
His armour was sable to view:  
All pleasure and laughter were hushed at his sight;  
The Dogs as They eyed him drew back in affright,  
The Lights in the chamber burned blue!  

His presence all bosoms appeared to dismay;  
The Guests sat in silence and fear.  
At length spoke the Bride, while She trembled;  
'I pray, Sir Knight, that your Helmet aside you would lay,  
And deign to partake of our chear.'  

The Lady is silent: The Stranger complies.  
His vizor lie slowly unclosed:  
Oh! God! what a sight met Fair Imogine's eyes! </pre></div> </div>
