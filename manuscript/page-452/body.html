The River on whose banks a Child I played,  
My Castle's antient Halls, its frowning Towers,  
Each much-regretted wood, and well-known Glade,  

Dreams of the land where all my wishes centre,  
Thy scenes, which I am doomed no more to know,  
Full oft shall Memory trace, my soul's Tormentor,  
And turn each pleasure past to present woe.  

But Lo! The Sun beneath the waves retires;  
Night speeds apace her empire to restore:  
Clouds from my sight obscure the village-spires,  
Now seen but faintly, and now seen no more.  

Oh! breathe not, Winds! Still be the Water's motion!  
Sleep, sleep, my Bark, in silence on the Main!  
So when to-morrow's light shall gild the Ocean, </pre></div> </div>
