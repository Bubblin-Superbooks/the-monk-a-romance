What words can express her dismay and surprize,  
When a Skeleton's head was exposed.  

All present then uttered a terrified shout;  
All turned with disgust from the scene.  
The worms, They crept in, and the worms, They crept out,  
And sported his eyes and his temples about,  
While the Spectre addressed Imogine.  

'Behold me, Thou false one! Behold me!' He cried;  
'Remember Alonzo the Brave!  
God grants, that to punish thy falsehood and pride  
My Ghost at thy marriage should sit by thy side,  
Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as Bride  
And bear thee away to the Grave!' </pre></div> </div>
