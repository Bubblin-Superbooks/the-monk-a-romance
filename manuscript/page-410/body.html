That heaving breast, those sparkling eyes  
Declare me ever dear and all my faults forgiven.  

     'Again beloved, esteemed, carest,  
Cupid shall in thine arms be prest,  
Sport on thy knees, or on thy bosom sleep:  
My Torch thine age-struck heart shall warm;  
My Hand pale Winter's rage disarm,  
And Youth and Spring shall here once more their revels keep.'â€”  

     A feather now of golden hue  
He smiling from his pinion drew;  
This to the Poet's hand the Boy commits;  
And straight before Anacreon's eyes  
The fairest dreams of fancy rise,  
And round his favoured head wild inspiration flits. </pre></div> </div>
