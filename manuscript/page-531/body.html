<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Then show me how a seat to gain  
Amidst those blissful realms of  
Air; Teach me to shun each guilty stain,  
And guide me to the good and fair.  

     So every morn and night, my Voice  
To heaven the grateful strain shall raise;  
In You as Guardian Powers rejoice,  
Good Angels, and exalt your praise:  

     So will I strive with zealous fire  
Each vice to shun, each fault correct;  
Will love the lessons you inspire,  
And Prize the virtues you protect.  

     Then when at length by high command  
My body seeks the Grave's repose,  
When Death draws nigh with friendly hand </pre></div> </div>
