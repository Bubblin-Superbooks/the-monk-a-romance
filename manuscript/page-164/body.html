'Eyes, which forth beheld me going,  
Homewards ne'er shall see me hie!  
Cousin, stop those tears o'er-flowing,  
Let me on thy bosom die!  

'Thy kind hand my eyelids closing,  
Yet one favour I implore:  
Pray Thou for my Soul's reposing,  
When my heart shall throb no more;  

'So shall Jesus, still attending  
Gracious to a Christian's vow,  
Pleased accept my Ghost ascending,  
And a seat in heaven allow.'  

Thus spoke gallant Durandarte; </pre></div> </div>
