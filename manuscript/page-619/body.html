<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">

In sighs to pass the live-long day,  
To taste a short and broken sleep,  
For one dear Object far away,  
All others scorned, to watch and weep,  
Such are the pains of Love, and Oh!  
I grieve so well Love's pains to know!  

To read consent in virgin eyes,  
To press the lip ne'er prest till then  
To hear the sigh of transport rise,  
And kiss, and kiss, and kiss again,  
Such are thy pleasures, Love, But Oh!  
When shall my heart thy pleasures know?
