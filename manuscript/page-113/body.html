That few for aught but folly lusted;  
That He was still deceiv'd, who trusted  
       In Love or Friend;  
And hither came with Men disgusted  
       My life to end.  

In this lone Cave, in garments lowly,  
Alike a Foe to noisy folly,  
And brow-bent gloomy melancholy  
       I wear away  
My life, and in my office holy  
       Consume the day.  

Content and comfort bless me more in  
This Grot, than e'er I felt before in  
A Palace, and with thoughts still soaring  
       To God on high, </pre></div> </div>
