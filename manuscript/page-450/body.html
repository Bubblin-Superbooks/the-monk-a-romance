Bid all I value, all I love, adieu.  

No more mine ear shall list the well-known ditty  
Sung by some Mountain-Girl, who tends her Goats,  
Some Village-Swain imploring amorous pity,  
Or Shepherd chaunting wild his rustic notes:  

No more my arms a Parent's fond embraces,  
No more my heart domestic calm, must know;  
Far from these joys, with sighs which Memory traces,  
To sultry skies, and distant climes I go.  

Where Indian Suns engender new diseases,  
Where snakes and tigers breed, I bend my way  
To brave the feverish thirst no art appeases,  
The yellow plague, and madding blaze of day: </pre></div> </div>
