Each night and morn with voice imploring  
       This wish I sigh.  

'Let me, Oh! Lord! from life retire,  
Unknown each guilty worldly fire,  
Remorseful throb, or loose desire;  
       And when I die,  
Let me in this belief expire,  
       "To God I fly"!'  

Stranger, if full of youth and riot  
As yet no grief has marred thy quiet,  
Thou haply throw'st a scornful eye at  
       The Hermit's prayer:  
But if Thou hast a cause to sigh at  
       Thy fault, or care; </pre></div> </div>
