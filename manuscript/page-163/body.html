Give it to Belerma's care.  

Say, I of my lands Possessor  
Named her with my dying breath:  
Say, my lips I op'd to bless her,  
Ere they closed for aye in death:  

'Twice a week too how sincerely  
I adored her, Cousin, say;  
Twice a week for one who dearly  
Loved her, Cousin, bid her pray.  

'Montesinos, now the hour  
Marked by fate is near at hand:  
Lo! my arm has lost its power!  
Lo! I drop my trusty brand! </pre></div> </div>
