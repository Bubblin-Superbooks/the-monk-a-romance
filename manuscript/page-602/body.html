Her Partner is the Water-spright.  

Oh! had some spirit deigned to sing,  
'Your Partner is the Water-King!'  
The Maid had fear and hate confest,  
And cursed the hand which then She prest.  

But nothing giving cause to think,  
How near She strayed to danger's brink,  
Still on She went, and hand in hand  
The Lovers reached the yellow sand.  

'Ascend this Steed with me, my Dear;  
We needs must cross the streamlet here;  
Ride boldly in; It is not deep;  
The winds are hushed, the billows sleep.' </pre></div> </div>
