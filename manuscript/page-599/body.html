While by the fragrant flowery side  
The lovely Maid with carols gay  
To Mary's Church pursued her way.  

The Water-Fiend's malignant eye  
Along the Banks beheld her hie;  
Straight to his Mother-witch He sped,  
And thus in suppliant accents said:  

'Oh! Mother! Mother! now advise,  
How I may yonder Maid surprize:  
Oh! Mother! Mother! Now explain,  
How I may yonder Maid obtain.' </pre></div> </div>
