By Thee were marked with sighs and tears,  
I think thy friendship false, and shun the guileful snare.  

     'I have not yet forgot the pains  
I felt, while bound in Julia's chains;  
The ardent flames with which my bosom burned;  
The nights I passed deprived of rest;  
The jealous pangs which racked my breast;  
My disappointed hopes, and passion unreturned.  

     'Then fly, and curse mine eyes no more!  
Fly from my peaceful Cottage-door!  
No day, no hour, no moment shalt Thou stay.  
I know thy falsehood, scorn thy arts,  
Distrust thy smiles, and fear thy darts;  
Traitor, begone, and seek some other to betray!' </pre></div> </div>
