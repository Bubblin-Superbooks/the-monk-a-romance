But not to feel slow pangs consume my liver,  
To die by piece-meal in the bloom of age,  
My boiling blood drank by insatiate fever,  
And brain delirious with the day-star's rage,  

Can make me know such grief, as thus to sever  
With many a bitter sigh, Dear Land, from Thee;  
To feel this heart must doat on thee for ever,  
And feel, that all thy joys are torn from me!  

Ah me! How oft will Fancy's spells in slumber  
Recall my native Country to my mind!  
How oft regret will bid me sadly number  
Each lost delight and dear Friend left behind!
