<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Attracted by the harmonious sound,  
Sylvans and Fauns the Cot surround,  
And curious crowd the Minstrel to behold:  
The Wood-nymphs haste the spell to prove;  
Eager They run; They list, they love,  
And while They hear the strain, forget the Man is old.  

     Cupid, to nothing constant long,  
Perched on the Harp attends the song,  
Or stifles with a kiss the dulcet notes:  
Now on the Poet's breast reposes,  
Now twines his hoary locks with roses,  
Or borne on wings of gold in wanton circle floats.  

     Then thus Anacreonâ€”'I no more  
At other shrine my vows will pour,  
Since Cupid deigns my numbers to inspire:  
From Phoebus or the blue-eyed Maid </pre></div> </div>
