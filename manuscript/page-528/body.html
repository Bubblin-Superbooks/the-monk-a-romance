No longer swells the nightly gale:  
Thy awful presence, Hour sublime,  
With spotless heart once more I hail.  

     'Tis now the moment still and dread,  
When Sorcerers use their baleful power;  
When Graves give up their buried dead  
To profit by the sanctioned hour:  

     From guilt and guilty thoughts secure,  
To duty and devotion true,  
With bosom light and conscience pure,  
Repose, thy gentle aid I woo.  

     Good Angels, take my thanks, that still </pre></div> </div>
