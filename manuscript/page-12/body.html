Shall line the trunk, or wrap the candle!  

     But should you meet with approbation,  
And some one find an inclination  
To ask, by natural transition  
Respecting me and my condition;  
That I am one, the enquirer teach,  
Nor very poor, nor very rich;  
Of passions strong, of hasty nature,  
Of graceless form and dwarfish stature;  
By few approved, and few approving;  
Extreme in hating and in loving;  

     Abhorring all whom I dislike,  
Adoring who my fancy strike;  
In forming judgements never long,  
And for the most part judging wrong; </pre></div> </div>
