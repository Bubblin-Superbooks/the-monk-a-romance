     His bosom glows with amorous fire  
Eager He grasps the magic lyre;  
Swift o'er the tuneful chords his fingers move:  
The Feather plucked from Cupid's wing  
Sweeps the too-long-neglected string,  
While soft Anacreon sings the power and praise of Love.  

     Soon as that name was heard, the Woods  
Shook off their snows; The melting floods  
Broke their cold chains, and Winter fled away.  
Once more the earth was deckt with flowers;  
Mild Zephyrs breathed through blooming bowers;  
High towered the glorious Sun, and poured the blaze of day.
