The waters o'er my bosom flow!'â€”  
Scarce was the word pronounced, when Knight  
And Courser vanished from her sight.  

She shrieks, but shrieks in vain; for high  
The wild winds rising dull the cry;  
The Fiend exults; The Billows dash,  
And o'er their hapless Victim wash.  

Three times while struggling with the stream,  
The lovely Maid was heard to scream;  
But when the Tempest's rage was o'er,  
The lovely Maid was seen no more.  

Warned by this Tale, ye Damsels fair,  
To whom you give your love beware!  
Believe not every handsome Knight, </pre></div> </div>
