Oh! Breathe in gentle strain, my Lyre!  
'Tis here that Beauty loves to rest:  
Describe the pangs of fond desire,  
Which rend a faithful Lover's breast.  

Song  

In every heart to find a Slave,  
In every Soul to fix his reign,  
In bonds to lead the wise and brave,  
And make the Captives kiss his chain,  
Such is the power of Love, and Oh!  
I grieve so well Love's power to know. </pre></div> </div>
