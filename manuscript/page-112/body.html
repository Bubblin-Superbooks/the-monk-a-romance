Think not, though from the world receding  
I joy my lonely days to lead in  
       This Desart drear,  
That with remorse a conscience bleeding  
       Hath led me here.  

No thought of guilt my bosom sowrs:  
Free-willed I fled from courtly bowers;  
For well I saw in Halls and Towers  
       That Lust and Pride,  
The Arch-Fiend's dearest darkest Powers,  
       In state preside.  

I saw Mankind with vice incrusted;  
I saw that Honour's sword was rusted; </pre></div> </div>
