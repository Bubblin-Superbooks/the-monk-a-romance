The Ghost in pain, and Fiend unblest:  

     Let not the Tempter in mine ear  
Pour lessons of unhallowed joy;  
Let not the Night-mare, wandering near  
My Couch, the calm of sleep destroy;  

     Let not some horrid dream affright  
With strange fantastic forms mine eyes;  
But rather bid some vision bright  
Display the bliss of yonder skies.  

     Show me the crystal Domes of Heaven,  
The worlds of light where Angels lie;  
Shew me the lot to Mortals given,  
Who guiltless live, who guiltless die.
